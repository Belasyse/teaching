## Cc

Carbon copying multiple companies/agencies into the same job application is, by far, the __worst__ thing you can do. It flags to *everyone* receiving the e-mail that your job application is a generic catch-all, but more importantly it also shows that you don't know how to use e-mail (BCc?!).

And because all the companies know you're sending a blanket e-mail, they also know that nothing in your application can be specific to them...__Delete__!

## Spelling and Grammar

Ideally, there should be none. Not that it's the end of the world, but poor spelling and grammar often creates a puzzled / jarring experience whilst reading an application.

English might not be your first language, you might have dyslexia, or you might just genuinely suck at sentence structure. That's completely fine, just get a second pair of eyes on what you've written. I'd also suggest reading it slowly and out-loud to yourself; it helps to catch duplicated and/or missing words from when you've re-worded a sentence.

And, by all means, spell the __job role__, __company__ and __city__ correctly.

## "Dear Sir/Madam"

_"Dear Sir/Madam"_, _"To whom it may concern"_ and the like are also an automatic red flag to an employer. Apart from sounding dry and boring, it suggests to us that you've:
* not spent the time to research the company properly (e.g. find a name).
* you're merely copy/pasting your applications from vacancy to vacancy (but not Cc'ing).

Many job posts __will tell you__ who to address it to, and if they don't then there's almost always a _"Meet the Team"_ page (like [ours](http://www.mixd.co.uk/about/#phil)). Failing that, get in touch with the company/agency and just ask. By e-mail, by phone or even through Twitter, just drop them the question: _"I'm about to send my application, who should I address it to?"_.

For example, if you're applying to *Mixd* it is a literal two-minute job to turn _"Dear Sir/Madam"_ into _"Dear Phil, Mike and the team"_. It's a small touch, but do you see how much more personal that is and how little effort it took?

## Writing an Essay

Many applicants make the mistake of trying to say absolutely everything in the e-mail. Instead of a short paragraph merely stating "it's a job application", they'll plough full-steam ahead into their marketing talk about the passion they have and the skills they possess. By the time they send the e-mail, it's a full-on essay.

Fact is, it's unlikely that the recipient will have the time to read your application the very second your e-mail hits their inbox. What's more likely is that they'll tag and archive all job applications and come back to them when they've got a moment to digest them all properly.

Keeping it short and to the point makes it much easier for your portfolio, cover letter and CV do the the talking!

## Clear Links

You'll be surprised how many applications Mixd have received where the only link to their portfolio is buried on the third page of their CV. We've even had applications where the there was no link; not that the portfolio didn't exist, you had to fish it off the e-mail address.

Don't make your potential employer hunt for links. Perhaps list what's in your job application:

* CV (attached)
* Cover Letter (attached)
* [Portfolio](http://www.mixd.co.uk/work/)
