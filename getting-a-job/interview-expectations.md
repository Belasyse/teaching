## Interview Questions

#### "What attracted you to the role?"
This question often acts as a roundabout way of testing whether you've done your research. If you have, there should be plenty of things about the company that drew you to them:

* the type of work they do
* the work they've done
* their approach to working and general ethos
* what they've talked / written about

#### "What do you hope to gain from joining us?"
By joining, you'd be getting an insight into how the company works and any specialisations they have. So again, it's a test of how well you know the company and its portfolio and how you'd compliment those aspects of the company.

For example for *Mixd*, it'd be all about usability, big informational websites and tech best practices (Responsive Web Design, Sass, BEM, GitHub).

Don't be afraid to mention any perks that were mentioned alongside the job. For example, a conference allowance is a big attraction if you've wanted to attend conferences and workshops but haven't been able to afford it.

#### "By joining, what would you bring to the company?"
Firstly, this is to nail down that you understand the job requirements. As standard, you should be ticking all their expectations (so long as they aren't ridiculously high/picky). If you've not had the opportunity yet, this is the point to reiterate how what you do marries up with their requirements.

This is also the perfect opportunity to bring any broader skills you have that will benefit the company. For example, if it's a front-end developer role then the core skills they're looking for is HTML / CSS, but if you're strong in other related areas – like speccing, user research, sitemapping and wireframing – then now is a good time to mention it. It demonstrates that you're thinking beyond merely filling a hole in their team.

#### "Have you got any examples where you've done *X*?"
This is another way the company may size up your suitability. The *X* is likely something from their requirement list and you'd be expected to be able to describe what you did. To get to the interview stage you'll have likely provided examples, but now is the time to talk about something in detail / at length. You're here to reassure them that you're a fit for the job, so being able to talk at length (and with enthusiasm!) is expected for something you're going to be doing daily.

#### "What do you do outside of day-to-day work?"
Don't worry, they're not expecting you to be a workaholic robot, this helps guage whether this is "just a job that pays the bills" or something you're truly passionate about. Typical examples would be: attending meet-ups, taking part in hackathons or working on side projects (alone or with others). 

Don't be afraid to go into some personal hobbies; you never know what common ground you might find! (e.g. road/mountain cycling). 

#### "How do you keep inspired / keep up?"
The tech and methodologies of this industry are famously fast-paced, so this question primarily acts as a check that you've got a close ear on what's going on.  

* Blogs, books and/or podcasts you read / listen to
* Twitter accounts you follow
* Meet-ups and conferences you attend
* Tools you've recently tried out

But also don't be afraid to branch out into other areas that are inspiring you; whether it's something related like graphic/print design or something broader like music.
