## Getting a Job

#### "What are your tips for job searching?"

As the cliche goes, *"it's not what you know, but who you know"*...and in the web industry, that does ring true when it comes to finding a job. Filling a job vacancy often starts out with personal recommendations, so whether you're the employer or employee, that 'friend in the industry' acts as an extra pair of eyes and ears.

Go to meet-ups, hackathons and conferences...I cannot stress how well face-to-face meeting works. That e-mail and phone barrier you might be bouncing off comes crashing down when you're just a bunch of people stood in a room. You never know who might be on the search for new talent...or knows / works for someone who is. And don't just do it for the networking, do it to meet new people in the industry, you'll make some great friends.

Twitter is also a good resource for the same reason. Retweets spread the word about your job vacancy / job hunt; you may get spotted by an agency from a friend retweeting you, or you may hear about a job vacancy because someone you followed retweeted a company.

Simply searching around the local agencies is always worth doing. If they're looking for a job, it'll be posted there.

Job boards like [Smashing Magazine](http://jobs.smashingmagazine.com/) and [Hire My Friend](http://hiremyfriend.io/) are also a good place to keep an eye on.

Personally, *Mixd* don't work with recruiters as we find that other avenues find the talent quicker and without the cost.

It's also worth mentioning that just because a company doesn't have a vacancy posted, it doesn't mean they aren't open for work. Any [good] company would be crazy not to snap up a great candidate should they come knocking. You'll never know until you enquire.

#### "What are your tips for job applications?"

Mike's written a great blog post titled ["The Three R's of Job Applications"](http://www.mixd.co.uk/blog/the-three-rs-of-job-applications/) and Jason's compiled some of [the common faux pas](https://github.com/Mixd/so-you-want-to-work-in-the-web-resources/blob/master/getting-a-job/application-faux-pas.md) we've had over the last few months.

#### "What should/shouldn't my CV cover?"

Your CV should be short, sweet and to the point. Don't add fluff if it's going to shroud your main points and messages. 

What you include in your CV, how you structure it, and how detailed you go is often determined by how far along in your career you are. It's all about relevance to the job vacany and the company you're applying to. For example, someone 8 years into their career would likely condense all their education and focus more on where they've worked. In contrast, a graduate with irrelevant work would likely pull their qualifications to the top.

As a graduate, you might have limited relevant work experience and feel obliged to sugar-coat irrelevant; like a Barista at Starbucks when you're applying for a Front-end Developer role. Definitely do still mention this work, it proves you aren't work shy, just don't go on about how it's improved your "team building" and "customer service" skills.

Also Remember that your CV isn't the readers only insight into you; blogs and social networks (e.g. Facebook & Twitter) can quickly build a picture of who you are. Take that as both a warning and a blessing!

#### "What should go in my portfolio?"

What your portfolio is depends on what you do, but regardless it exists to impress your potential employer. It is perhaps your core tool for getting noticed and go through to the interview stage.

Whether it's design, front-end, back-end or a hybrid of them all, the key is in quality and relevance. For example, if you're applying for a company that does some big property websites, and quite a bit of your best work is doing property websites, then you're in good stead.

If you don't have anything directly relevant, don't fret...just put your best work forward. If your relevant is a bit old and dated, still include it towards the back as a *"I've built for this sector before"* hat tip.

It's worth mentioning not to over-stuff a portfolio for the sake of it being full. For example, if the addition of a 10th piece would drag down the general quality of the existing nine, just keep it at nine.

#### "What should I expect in an interview?"

Every company has a different interview technique, but at it's core an interview is there to marry up your ability to the vacancy. So be expected to talk at length about any and all requirements in relation to you and to talk about your portfolio examples in length.

Here are some [interview questions](https://github.com/Mixd/so-you-want-to-work-in-the-web-resources/blob/master/getting-a-job/interview-expectations.md), with tips alongside.

#### "Fresh out of university, what salary expectations should I have?"

It depends entirely on your location and ability, but as a web developer fresh from graduation (and outside London) you should be looking at between __£18,000 - £20,000 per year__.

That is probably lower than you thought, but the key message here is that your starting salary doesn't really matter. You should be looking for a company that's quick to recognise your developing skills and adjust your salary to reflect it. Fact is, you *could* land a £23k job straight from university, but pay reviews are essentially non-existent. You'll be stagnant at that salary and feel that the only way to earn more would be from finding a new job. Whilst someone who started on £18k could quickly chase up (and beyond) that figure by joining a company that constantly accesses your ability.

You've got to remember that graduate roles are a much riskier investment than someone with a proven track record, so the salary is naturally going to be a bit lower.

## About Mixd

#### "How did Mixd start?"

Mike and Phil worked together at Brahm (now [Brass](http://www.brassagency.com/)). After a while of asking the question *"why aren't we doing this for ourselves?"* they made the leap and created *Mixd*. With a Mike with a background in print, and Phil with a background in digital, the mix of the mediums is where the name came from.

#### "Why did you choose Harrogate?"

It was partly because not to become "just enough Leeds-based company", partly because of the commute. Both Phil and Mike are live closer to Harrogate than Leeds, so to set up in Leeds and commute in everyday just seemed silly.

#### "Do clients visit you on-site or do you visit them?"

It's a mixture really; it comes down to convenience, available facilities and distance for both parties.

If the meeting is expected to have lots of client representatives, then it makes more sense to do the meeting at their offices and for Phil/Mike to go to them.

There are exceptions, like when the meeting requires some technical input from Jason/Aaron but doesn't require them to sit in on the entire meeting, or when we need to talk through the post-it note sitemap that's been produced in the meeting room.

As we've got a nicer office, and a meeting room that's more fitting, meetings do seem to happen on-site more often.

#### "How do you keep existing clients happy?"

By keeping in touch.

Websites aren't like a printed brochure that you ship off and never see again, they evolve over time with the new ideas that clients come up with. By listening, you can help coach and polish these ideas so the current website improves over time.

By listening, you can also act on their complaints *as they happen*, rather than letting them build up into something drastic. We use [Help Scout](https://www.helpscout.net/) to manage incoming issues and requests; we act on anything from an existing client directly from Help Scout.

We also have maintenance contracts in place. Clients buy a fixed amount of time per month and we use them for improvements and upgrades to prolong a website's life. Clients on maintenance contracts get quarterly audits on their websites, where *Mixd* suggest how we can improve the website. This usually includes using new technology that has been released since the website was launched. For example, after our experience of using [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) for the comments on [Mixd](http://www.mixd.co.uk/), a move to *Disqus* for the client might be suggested.
