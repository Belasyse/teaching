# Clothing Boutique

*Example*: [Capture Apparel](http://captureapparel.co.uk/)

For this brief, you'll be creating a website for a clothing boutique. The tasks will relate to the main tasks in the session, you'll just be doing them in the context of the store.

## Task 2: Pages/Posts

Like most business websites, we're going to have a _Home_, _About Us_ and _Contact Us_ page.
We'll also have a blog.

Create the relevant pages, and populate a _Blog_ category with a few blog posts (from any source).

## Task 3: Theming

Once you've got to grips with the basics of a how a theme functions, you could begin by adding a page template, assigning it to a page and tweaking the layout on that page. You could also tweak the loop for the blog.

## Task 4:

* Create a _Products_ custom post type
* Create a _Size_ and _Type_ taxonomy (and populate them)
* Add a few products (and categorise them with the taxonomies)
* Add a _Price_ custom field
* Add a _Price_ shortcode
