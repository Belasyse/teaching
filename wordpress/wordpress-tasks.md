# WordPress Practical

We know you've all had a different amount of exposure to WordPress, so to give everyone an equal footing we'll be running this session from the very start. There are estimated times attached, but just go through them at your own pace.

At the set times, I will be doing on-screen demos. Even if you're not up to that task, it'd probably be worth watching anyway because it'll only be a few minutes interruption.

I plan to do the entire session myself, live on screen. I'll then place the work in the GitHub repo (as a database and a theme folder) for you take away and study afterwards.

## Task 1: Installation
Duration: _15 minutes_

[Download WordPress](http://wordpress.org/download/) and follow [the installation process](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress#Famous_5-Minute_Install)

Once you're up and running, log into the admin. I'd like us to steer away from styling for this session, so I'm going to suggest using a theme called [Starkers](https://github.com/viewportindustries/starkers). It has many of the common starting files, but none of the styling.

## Task 2: Page/Post Basics
Duration: _20 minutes_

A quick on-screen demo of the admin, how pages/posts differ and how to categorise and/or tag.

You'll now be let loose on your own project; you can either build something relevant to you, build your online portfolio/blog, or attempt [clothing store](https://github.com/Mixd/so-you-want-to-work-in-the-web-resources/edit/master/wordpress/clothing-store-brief.md) brief. It's just much easier to grasp WordPress when what you're doing is based around some sort of context.

## Task 3: Theming
Duration: _1 hour_

Now you've got a few pages/posts to play with, we'll dive into the world of theming.

Another on-screen demo I'll be doing, covering:
* Theme file structure
* How a theme chooses what file to use
* How that file knits together with other core files
* The loop (and its functions)
* A custom loop

## Task 4: Extending
Duration: _1 hour_

How to extend WordPress by means of plugins, and self-written code within _functions.php_

Another on-screen demo I'll be doing, covering:
* Adding a custom post type
* Adding a custom taxonomy
* Installing a plugin
* Adding custom fields to an item
* Shortcodes
