# Wireframing

Lets move away from the code for a little while and focus our attention on the structure and layout of a Responsive Website. Now that we have a [gazillion](http://devicelab.fi/img/office-sml.jpg) differnet devices to design for, wireframing is an incredibly important part of the design process. It gives us a way to quickly prototype layout decisions for multiple sizes.

## Task 1

What you'll need for this section:
- A wireframing sheet we will provide for you
- Pen/Pencil or anything else you can 'draw' with. Don't worry, I'm no artist myself.

### Step 1
Sketch out one or more wireframes using the sketch sheets provided. Work from the narrowest frame first and consider how you might rearrange and display content at different widths. Draw elements as simple boxes and donâ€™t spend time on detail. The purpose of the task is to consider content and layout, not design and aesthetics.

Be sure to include the following elements:
- Logo
- Primary navigation consisting of 4 links: Home, Products, Services, Blog
- Secondary Navigation: About Us, Contact Us, FAQ
- Search form
- Content: Page title, text and 4 small content blocks
- Sidebar: 3 x panels
- Footer: Tertiary links, Copyright

### Step 2
Think about your own Web projects and how you can wireframe out the layouts that you'll need at different breakpoints. Do you have a slideshow in your project? How would that look like at Mobile? How does the navigation work at different sizes? Think about the apps and sites you go on. What do Facebook and Twitter do? Can you take any idea from their layouts.
